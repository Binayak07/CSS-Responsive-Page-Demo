through overflow property we can set the stuffs if we find anything overflowing from the page. 
overflow: hidden; //we can just hide it


text-decoration: none;
means if we want no underline on any link then we can use it. link will not have an underline if we set this property as none, other values as underline, line-thorugh and overline.

text-transform is a property through which we can set any text upper or lower case using CSS only.

by default <ul> and <h1>s have padding and margin, we need to set it to zero before applying any stuff on it. (try it in editor)
